# Briefly about myself:

Start working from high school because wanted more independence from my parents. I was combining school and work, so by this time i had increased my discipline and soft skills. This advantage gave me more chances to get a better job in a new city where i will be studying in university.

 Now im in Novosibirsk working as a barista in a best brew-bar or coffee shop named Skuratov Coffee. It is a place where people can charge not so much by coffee as by the atmosphere. A year and a half of experience working with people, handle conflicts, provide feedback to many colleagues and higher management to become better and save fruitful atmosphere. 

Had self-studying Frontend Development for about 3-4 months and decided to get courses mainly because of a mentor. I believe that my pesistence and feedback from mentor will lead me through tough path of becoming Frontend Developer.

In this project i learnt vue 3 and how to interact with it. Also write on composition API style and made some simple animation coupled with validation, w/0 external libraries. It's responsive and adaptive, so it allows you to use the application from different devices
